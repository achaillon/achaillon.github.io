This analysis provides insights into the timing of admissions, and the distribution of deaths over time during the outbreak from Aug 5, 2018 to Jul 15, 2019.\n\n\n\nWeekly Cases by Sex\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Cases by Outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporal Trends in Cases and Case Fatality Rate\nTo explore outbreak dynamics, we examined daily counts of confirmed Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) cases and their corresponding case fatality rates (CFR) over time.\nThis visualization shows how the number of new admissions and the proportion of fatal outcomes evolved by date of symptom onset or date of admission throughout the North Kivu outbreak.\n\n\n\nOver time\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Cases and CFR over time\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Admission\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Cases and CFR from Admission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptoms and Clinical Signs\nWe assessed the prevalence of symptoms and clinical Signs among 463 confirmed EVD cases admitted during the North Kivu outbreak.\nSymptoms\nCommonly reported symptoms included fatigue/weakness (84%), anorexia (64%), diarrhoea (59%), and difficulty breathing (11%), with less frequent manifestations such as seizures (1%) or irritability/confusion (1.3%).\nWe further examined the distribution of these features by patient outcome (death vs. recovery), revealing that symptoms such as diarrhea, anorexia, and fatigue were more frequent among patients who died, while most clinical signs were uncommon regardless of outcome.\nThe plots below visualize these patterns, highlighting both the overall prevalence and outcome-specific differences.\n\n\n\nOverall Prevalence\n\n\n\n\n(#fig:sx_overall)Symptoms Prevalence\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Outcome\n\n\n\n\n(#fig:sx_outcome)Symptoms Prevalence by Outcome\n\n\n\n\n\nOvertime\n\n\n\n\n(#fig:sx_time)Symptoms Prevalence through time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Signs\nOverall, most clinical signs were rare. However, some differences were notable:\n- Bleeding was observed in 22 patients who died (≈15% of deaths) compared to 15 patients who recovered (≈6% of recoveries).\n- Conjunctival injection or bleeding occurred more frequently in deceased patients (≈8%) than in survivors (≈5%).\n- Other signs such as jaundice, tender abdomen, or sunken eyes were infrequent across both outcomes.\nThe plots below visualize these patterns, highlighting both the overall prevalence and outcome-specific differences.\n\n\n\nOverall Prevalence\n\n\n\n\n(#fig:clin_all)Prevalence of Clinical Signs\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Outcome\n\n\n\n\n(#fig:clin_outcome)Prevalence of Clinical Signs by Outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcomes by Admission Delay\nEarly diagnosis and timely admission are critical determinants of survival in Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The time between symptom onset and admission influences both viral load at presentation and subsequent clinical outcomes. The cycle threshold (Ct) value from RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal or blood samples serves as a proxy for viral load, with lower Ct values indicating higher viral burden. Evaluating the relationship between Ct values, admission delay, and patient outcomes helps to better understand disease progression and prognosis.\nWe examined the relationship between diagnostic RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, admission delay, and patient outcomes among confirmed EVD cases. Ct values were obtained from initial diagnostic tests performed on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected at admission. Admission delay was defined as the number of days between reported symptom onset and admission to the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC).\nPatient outcomes (survived vs. deceased) were compared across categories of admission delay, and Ct values were compared between outcome groups using Welch’s t-test. The association between Ct value and admission delay was assessed using simple linear regression. Analyses were conducted in R (version 4.4.1) using the ggplot2, dplyr, and stats packages.\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Patients\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Number of Patients by Outcome and Admission Delay\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Proportion of Patients by Outcome and Admission Delay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot below 6 compares admission delays between patients who recovered and those who died during the North Kivu outbreak. Overall, patients with fatal outcomes were admitted later than survivors:\nDeceased patients (n = 147) had a median admission delay of 5 days (IQR = 4.5; range = 0–39).\nRecovered patients (n = 253) had a median admission delay of 3 days (IQR = 4; range = 0–32).\nThis pattern underscores the critical role of early detection and treatment initiation in improving EVD survival outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Admission Delay by Outcome\n\n\n\nCycle Threshold at Admission and Disease Progression\nThe cycle threshold (Ct) value obtained from RT-PCR at admission reflects the viral load of Ebola virus RNA with lower Ct values indicating higher viral loads.

Organ failures were inferred from laboratory results as follows:\nRenal impairment: Creatinine ≥ 1.1 mg/dL\nHyperkaliemia: Potassium > 5.5 mmol/L\nHypokaliemia: Potassium < 3.5 mmol/L\nRhabdomyolysis: Creatinine kinase > 1000 U/L\nSevere hypoglycemia: Glucose < 60 mg/dL\nSevere thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 50 ×10⁹/L\nKey findings include:\n- Renal impairment was observed in 20 patients who died (≈13%) versus 22 survivors (≈9%).\n- Rhabdomyolysis occurred more frequently in deceased patients (≈9%) compared to survivors (≈2%).\n- Hyperkaliemia was rare overall but more common in patients who died (≈4%) than in survivors (<1%).\n- Other failures such as hypokaliemia, severe hypoglycemia, and severe thrombocytopenia were uncommon in both outcomes.\nThese results highlight that renal and muscle-related organ failures are more prevalent among patients with fatal outcomes, suggesting potential prognostic relevance.\nWe also examined the prevalence and distribution of bleeding manifestations among EVD patients, stratified by outcome (death vs. recovery). Bleeding was categorized according to site, including intravenous (IVF) sites, urine, sputum, nose, rectum, mouth, and vagina.\nKey observations include:\n- Bleeding from rectum and mouth was most common among patients who died (≈5% each), compared with survivors (≈1–2%).\n- Nose bleeding occurred in 5 deceased patients (≈3%) versus 2 survivors (≈1%).\n- Vaginal bleeding was observed more frequently in survivors (6 patients) than in deceased patients (3 patients).\n- Bleeding from IVF sites, urine, and other sites was rare.\nThese results indicate that gastrointestinal and mucosal bleeding is more frequently associated with fatal outcomes, whereas vaginal bleeding was relatively more common among survivors.\nThe plots below visualize the distribution of organ failures and bleeding by patient outcome.\n\n\n\nOrgan failures\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Organ failures\n\n\n\n\n\nBleeding\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Bleeding Sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatments and Outcomes\nWe examined the distribution of experimental treatments administered to patients and their corresponding clinical outcomes.\nKey observations include:\n- The lowest proportion of deaths was observed among patients receiving Zmapp (≈7%), whereas Remdesivir (GS-5734) had the highest mortality (≈37%) in this cohort.\n- Full recovery without sequelae was most frequent in patients treated with REGN3470-3471-3479 (≈28%) and mAb114 (≈26%).\nThe interactive drill-down pie chart below illustrates the proportion of patients receiving each treatment and, within each treatment group, the proportion who recovered with and without sequeale versus died.\nThis visualization highlights the relative contribution of different therapeutic interventions to overall patient outcomes during the North Kivu outbreak.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Distribution of Experimental Treatments and Patient Outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost recent data: July 17, 2019\nThe ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has posed significant public health challenges. Between Aug 5, 2018, and Jul 15, 2019, a total of 463 laboratory-confirmed EVD cases were admitted to six distinct Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs). Of these patients, 56% were women and 4% were children aged ≤5 years. During this period, 150 confirmed deaths occurred, corresponding to a case fatality rate (CFR) of approximately 32%.\nIn DRC, care for EVD patients is provided through ETCs co-managed by the National Ministry of Public Health (NMoPH) in collaboration with international partners, including the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), International Medical Corps (IMC), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Samaritan’s Purse (SP), and the World Health Organization (WHO) through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). These centers provide centralized, standardized clinical care and monitoring, enabling systematic collection of epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data critical for outcome analyses.\nThis dataset provides a unique opportunity to evaluate patient characteristics, clinical outcomes, and treatment effects, and to identify predictors of mortality and complications during the North Kivu outbreak. Analyses include stratification by demographic factors, laboratory measurements such as cycle threshold (Ct) values, timing of admission, and receipt of experimental therapies, providing insight into factors influencing survival and informing future outbreak response strategies.\nIn addition to analyses of the overall cohort, we conducted a subgroup evaluation in children (<18 years) to explore age-specific clinical features, laboratory findings, treatment patterns, and outcomes. This pediatric-focused analysis provides insight into how Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) manifests and progresses in younger patients, and allows comparison with the adult population to inform tailored clinical management and outbreak response strategies.\n\n\n\n\nCohort Description ⟶\n\nDescriptive Analysis of the cohort, temporal dynamics, Ct kinetics, Complications, Treatments and Outcomes\n\nEVD Outcome Modeling ⟶\n\n\nAnalysis to identify predictors of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outcomes and complications using a stepwise modeling workflow with multivariable poisson regression panels for death and complications,\n\nEVD Outcome Survival ⟶\n\n\nSurvival Analysis of Time to Outcome, stratified by multiple key variables to assess their association with time-to-event outcomes.\n\nEVD among Children ⟶\n\n\nSubgroup evaluation in children (<18 years) to explore age-specific clinical features, laboratory findings, treatment patterns, and outcomes.\n\nAbout the site ⟶\n\nData sources, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated Nov 8, 2025, 9:58 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Of these pediatric cases, 55% were girls and 29% were under 5 years of age.\nA total of 20 deaths were reported in this subgroup, corresponding to a case fatality rate (CFR) of 32%, similar to the overall cohort.\nIn the following analyses, we focus on demographics, clinical presentation, and outcomes in children, highlighting patterns that may differ from the adult population.\n\nNote: Eleven children had an unknown outcome at discharge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Population Pyramid by Age and Sex among Children\n\n\n\nPopulation Characteristics\n\n\n\nBy Age\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\n      Adult\nN = 3861\n      Children (<18)\nN = 621\n      p-value2\n    Age at admission\n–\n–\n0.00    Median (Min, Max)\n33 (18, 71)\n10 (0, 17)\n–Age Group\n–\n–\n0.00    <2\n0 (0%)\n10 (16%)\n–    2-5\n0 (0%)\n8 (13%)\n–    5-12\n0 (0%)\n20 (32%)\n–    12-17\n0 (0%)\n24 (39%)\n–    18+\n386 (100%)\n0 (0%)\n–Gender\n–\n–\n0.75    Male\n166 (43%)\n28 (45%)\n–    Female\n220 (57%)\n34 (55%)\n–Is the patient pregnant?\n15 (3.9%)\n1 (1.6%)\n0.71Admission Delay\n–\n–\n0.62    Median (Min, Max)\n4.0 (0.0, 34.0)\n4.0 (0.0, 39.0)\n–Ct (lowest)\n–\n–\n0.30    Median (Min, Max)\n24 (15, 42)\n23 (16, 40)\n–Ct Below 23\n124 (32%)\n21 (34%)\n0.78Does the patient have any comorbid conditions?\n8 (2.1%)\n0 (0%)\n0.61Diabetes\n1 (0.3%)\n0 (0%)\n1.00HIV\n3 (0.8%)\n0 (0%)\n1.00Chronic pulmonary disease \n1 (0.3%)\n0 (0%)\n1.00Bleeding\n33 (8.5%)\n7 (11%)\n0.48Fever\n8 (2.1%)\n45 (73%)\n0.00Diarrhoea\n8 (2.1%)\n15 (24%)\n0.00Shock\n2 (0.5%)\n0 (0%)\n1.00Confusion\n1 (0.3%)\n0 (0%)\n1.00Renal impairment\n41 (11%)\n3 (4.8%)\n0.16Rhabdomyolysis\n17 (4.4%)\n2 (3.2%)\n1.00Severe hypoglycemia\n6 (1.6%)\n1 (1.6%)\n1.00Hyperkaliemia\n5 (1.3%)\n2 (3.2%)\n0.25Hypokaliemia\n10 (2.6%)\n1 (1.6%)\n1.00Platelets (x10⁹/L)\n–\n–\n0.41    Median (Min, Max)\n168 (27, 385)\n106 (88, 164)\n–Haemoglobin (g/L)\n–\n–\n0.40    Median (Min, Max)\n13.30 (9.00, 17.90)\n12.00 (10.60, 13.80)\n–Ebola experimental treatment at admission\n170 (44%)\n25 (40%)\n0.58Type of Ebola experimental treament at admission\n–\n–\n0.37    REGN3470-3471-3479\n43 (11%)\n4 (6.5%)\n–    Remdesivir (GS-5734)\n53 (14%)\n5 (8.1%)\n–    Zmapp\n7 (1.8%)\n1 (1.6%)\n–    mAb114\n64 (17%)\n15 (24%)\n–    None\n219 (57%)\n37 (60%)\n–Days from Treament Initiation\n–\n–\n0.38    Median (Min, Max)\n4.0 (-361.0, 36.0)\n5.0 (0.0, 32.0)\n–Delay from Treament\n–\n–\n0.36    Less than 3 days\n69 (23%)\n11 (24%)\n–    3 to 5 days\n84 (28%)\n8 (18%)\n–    More than 5 days\n150 (50%)\n26 (58%)\n–Ebola experimental treatment\n306 (79%)\n45 (73%)\n0.23Type of Ebola experimental treament\n–\n–\n0.20    REGN3470-3471-3479\n93 (24%)\n11 (18%)\n–    Remdesivir (GS-5734)\n113 (29%)\n12 (19%)\n–    Zmapp\n22 (5.7%)\n5 (8.1%)\n–    mAb114\n78 (20%)\n17 (27%)\n–    None\n80 (21%)\n17 (27%)\n–Antibacterial treatment\n326 (84%)\n52 (84%)\n0.91Antimalarial treatment\n285 (74%)\n43 (69%)\n0.46Oral/orogastric fluids\n64 (17%)\n13 (21%)\n0.40Blood transfusion\n1 (0.3%)\n2 (3.2%)\n0.05Outcome at discharge\n–\n–\n0.48    Death\n126 (33%)\n20 (32%)\n–    Full recovery with sequelae\n1 (0.3%)\n0 (0%)\n–    Full recovery without sequelae\n216 (56%)\n31 (50%)\n–    Referred to another facility\n2 (0.5%)\n0 (0%)\n–    Unknown\n41 (11%)\n11 (18%)\n–1 n (%)\n    2 Wilcoxon rank sum test;

This analysis provides insights into the timing of admissions, and the distribution of deaths over time during the outbreak from Aug 5, 2018 to May 13, 2019.\n\n\n\nWeekly Cases by Sex\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Cases by Outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporal Trends in Cases and Case Fatality Rate\nTo explore outbreak dynamics, we examined daily counts of confirmed Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) cases and their corresponding case fatality rates (CFR) over time.\nThis visualization shows how the number of new admissions and the proportion of fatal outcomes evolved by date of symptom onset or date of admission throughout the North Kivu outbreak.\n\n\n\nOver time\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Cases and CFR over time\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Admission\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Cases and CFR from Admission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptoms and Clinical Signs\nSymptoms\nAmong the 62 pediatric cases, symptoms were generally less frequent than in the overall cohort, though notable exceptions were observed.\nFatigue/Weakness (n=44, 71%) and anorexia (n=36, 58%) were the most common presenting symptoms.\nSevere signs, such as desorientation, difficulty breathing, or agitation, were less frequent overall but occurred disproportionately among children who subsequently died.\nWhen stratified by outcome:\n- Children who died had higher proportions of anorexia (85%), fatigue/weakness (95%), and difficulty breathing (40%) compared with those who recovered, suggesting early clinical severity is associated with poorer outcomes.\nOverall, children tended to exhibit a milder symptom profile compared to the entire cohort, with fewer instances of severe clinical signs. However, certain symptoms, such as anorexia, fatigue/weakness, and difficulty breathing, were more commonly observed among children who did not survive.\nThe plots below visualize these patterns, highlighting both the overall prevalence and outcome-specific differences.\n\n\n\nOverall Prevalence\n\n\n\n\n(#fig:sx_overall)Symptoms Prevalence\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Outcome\n\n\n\n\n(#fig:sx_outcome)Symptoms Prevalence by Outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Signs\nOverall, children exhibited few clinical signs compared to the entire cohort, with bleeding (8.86%) and conjunctival injection/bleeding (6.48%) being the most frequently observed. Other signs, such as jaundice, oedema, and rash, were rare or absent.\nAmong children who died, bleeding was observed in 20% and conjunctival injection/bleeding in 5%, whereas these signs were less frequent among survivors.\nThe plots below visualize these patterns, highlighting both the overall prevalence and outcome-specific differences.\n\n\n\nOverall Prevalence\n\n\n\n\n(#fig:clin_all)Prevalence of Clinical Signs\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Outcome\n\n\n\n\n(#fig:clin_outcome)Prevalence of Clinical Signs by Outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcomes by Admission Delay\nAmong children (<18 years) with confirmed EVD, early diagnosis and admission remain critical for survival. Ct values from RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal or blood samples at admission were used as a proxy for viral load, with lower Ct values reflecting higher viral burden.\nWe evaluated the relationship between Ct values, admission delay (days from symptom onset to ETC admission), and patient outcomes (survived vs. deceased) in this pediatric cohort. Ct values were compared between outcome groups using Welch’s t-test, and their association with admission delay was assessed with linear regression. Analyses were conducted in R (v4.4.1) using ggplot2, dplyr, and base stats.\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Patients\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Number of Patients by Outcome and Admission Delay\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Proportion of Patients by Outcome and Admission Delay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot below 6 compares admission delays between children who recovered and those who died during the North Kivu outbreak. Overall, patients with fatal outcomes were admitted later than survivors:\nDeceased children (n=20) had a median admission delay of 7 days (range 1-39)\nRecovered children (n=31) had a median admission delay of 2 days (range 1-5)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Admission Delay by Outcome\n\n\n\nCycle Threshold at Admission and Disease Progression\nThe cycle threshold (Ct) value obtained from RT-PCR at admission reflects the viral load of Ebola virus RNA with lower Ct values indicating higher viral loads. Understanding the relationship between Ct, disease outcome, and clinical course provides key insights into disease severity and prognosis.\nAnalyses in this section explore:\nCases and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) by Ct — summarizing the relationship between viral load categories and mortality risk.\nCt at Admission by Outcome — comparing Ct distributions between survivors and non-survivors.\nCt and Delay at Admission — evaluating how admission timing influences initial viral load.\n\n\n\nCases and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) by Ct\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Cases and CFR by Ct\n\n\n\n\n\nCt at admission by Outcome\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Ct at admission by Outcome\n\n\n\n\n\nCt and Admission Delay\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Ct and Admission Delay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, these analyses provide an integrated view of how viral burden at presentation and over time correlates with clinical outcomes during the North Kivu EVD outbreak.\nComplications\nWe assessed the occurrence of organ failures among children with EVD, stratified by outcome (death vs. recovery). Organ failures were inferred from laboratory results (see Overall section).\nOverall, children experienced fewer severe complications compared to the entire cohort. Renal impairment (15%) and rhabdomyolysis (10%) were the most frequently observed severe laboratory abnormalities among pediatric cases. Hyperkaliemia and other metabolic disturbances were uncommon.\nThe plots below visualize the distribution of organ failures and bleeding by outcome.\n\n\n\nOrgan failures\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Organ failures\n\n\n\n\n\nBleeding\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Bleeding Sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatments and Outcomes\nWe examined the distribution of experimental treatments administered to patients and their corresponding clinical outcomes.\nAmong children (<18 years) with confirmed EVD, mortality varied by experimental treatment. The highest proportion of deaths occurred in those receiving Remdesivir (GS-5734, 45%), while lower death rates were observed with Zmapp (20%) and mAb114 (15%).\nFull recovery without sequelae was most frequent in children treated with REGN3470-3471-3479 (≈26%) and mAb114 (≈26%). A notable proportion of outcomes remained unknown, particularly for children receiving mAb114 (≈55%).\nThe interactive drill-down pie chart below illustrates the proportion of patients receiving each treatment and, within each treatment group, the proportion who recovered with and without sequeale versus died.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Distribution of Experimental Treatments and Patient Outcomes\n\n\n\nSurvival Analysis of Time to Outcome\nAs performed in the entire cohort, we estimated the probability of survival over time using a Weibull proportional hazards model.\nSurvival curves were stratified by multiple key variables to assess their association with time-to-event outcomes.\n\n\n\nBy experimental treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ct threshold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Admission delay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Treatment Delay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Age Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Sex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Adjusted Hazard Ratios\nTo summarize results visually, we produced forest plots showing aHRs with 95% CIs for each covariate. See 13. Reference categories were indicated for categorical variables, and p-values were reported alongside hazard ratios. These forest plots provide an integrated view of survival associations across all stratifications, enabling comparison of treatment effects, viral load (Ct), demographic factors, and admission timing.\nMedian predicted survival times were also estimated using the fitted Weibull models, and tabulated by strata to complement the forest plot visualizations.\nSee also analyses for the entire cohort.\nAll analyses were performed in R version 4.4.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Forest Plots of Weibull Model Estimates for Time-to-Event Outcome\n\n\n\nIndependent Predictors of EVD Outcome and Complications\nAs performed in the entire cohort, adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using multivariable Poisson regression with robust standard errors.

This approach aimed to increase model power and interpretability by reducing sparse variables while capturing clinically coherent syndromic patterns.\n\n\nTable 1.

Variables with sparse categories or those causing quasi-complete separation were excluded.\nCollinearity assessment — Remaining variables were tested for multicollinearity using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). Predictors with generalized VIF (GVIFscaled) values ≤ 1.68 were retained.\nLASSO regression — To refine the model, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression was applied, shrinking weak predictors and retaining the strongest associations.\nMultivariable logistic regression — Predictors selected by LASSO were entered into multivariable logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.\nComputation of risk ratios — For interpretability, adjusted risk ratios (RR) were derived from Poisson regression models with robust standard errors. Raw (unadjusted) RRs were also calculated for binary predictors.\nThis stepwise approach ensured model parsimony, minimized overfitting, and enhanced interpretability.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Stepwise Approach to Modeling Outcomes and Complications\n\n\n\nIndependent Predictors of EVD Outcome and Complications\nAdjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using multivariable Poisson regression with robust standard errors.

See 1. Reference categories were indicated for categorical variables, and p-values were reported alongside hazard ratios. These forest plots provide an integrated view of survival associations across all stratifications, enabling comparison of treatment effects, viral load (Ct), demographic factors, and admission timing.\nMedian predicted survival times were also estimated using the fitted Weibull models, and tabulated by strata to complement the forest plot visualizations.\nAll analyses were performed in R version 4.4.1.\nfor the ROC curve visualization.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Forest Plots of Weibull Model Estimates for Time-to-Event Outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
